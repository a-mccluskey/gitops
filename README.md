# gitops
Gitops repo for k8s cluster locally. Ideally to replicate what I know professionally & learn more about the k8s stack for personal use. Overall goal is to move multiple existing Windows services to a k8s stack

## Services
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Pihole (local DNS, will be needed for local lookup of each of the services here)
- MSSQL
- MySQL
- Dotnet 8 app
- PHP apps (for legacy projects)
- Lets Encrypt
- Ingress
- Jenkins (to build the dotnet 8 app & deploy the PHP legacy app)
- EFK stack (Elasticsearch/Fluentd/Kibana)
- Secret managment

## Nice to have
- Plex media server
- Minecraft server
- Owncloud/Nextcloud for iphone backups
- More eventually
